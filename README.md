# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my solution for this challenge.

This is a solution to the [Stats preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/stats-preview-card-component-8JqbgoU62). 
I tried to build the component and tried to get it looking as close to the design as possible by using HTML and CSS.

I am learning css yet I am still bad at media queries ðŸ˜“. So, it looks like I will continue to improve mobile designs of this prject for a while. But I am almost done!
